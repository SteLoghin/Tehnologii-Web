        <h2>Excuse me. I must have dozed off.
            It's rather warm in here.
            Well, well, hasn't it been all too long! It's good to see you.
            Oh, I seemed to have missed my chance, so...
            I, Siegward of Catarina, offer my deepest gratitude.
            And a little surprise to go with it. It's all yours.</h2>
        <h2>I know. Won't you join me for dinner?
            I make a fine estus soup. I've got some stewing right now.
            Even we Undead deserve a little normalcy, from time to time.
            And finally, upon this rendezvous, let us make a toast.
            To your valour, my sword, and our sworn duties! Long may the sun shine!</h2>
        <h2>Have you heard?
            Somewhere, hidden right here in Irithyll, is a deep dungeon.
            And even below that, the Profaned Capital.
            Home of Yhorm, the reclusive giant lord.
            That remonds me, I've a grave promise to keep...</h2>
        <h2>Oh, sorry, I'm afraid I've cast a cloud over things.
            Well, I'm going to have myself a little nap.
            The only thing to do, really, after a nice toast.</h2>
